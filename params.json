You can then send the signal \r\n\r\nthrough the arduino's usb via serial to midi program (I recommend Hairless and \r\n\r\nloopMIDI), or through an installed midi port. \r\nPlease note that I have only tested on my computer. If it isn't working, the baud rate may need to be changed to work with a midi port.\r\n\r\nCan play in a range of 32 notes (just under 3 octaves) through increasingly intense fret progressions. In general, the more fret buttons held down, the higher the note. \r\n\r\nThe code is (hopefully) straightforward enough for you to change things if you like.

You can then send the signal \r\n\r\nthrough the arduino's usb (via serial to midi program. I recommend Hairless and \r\n\r\nloopMIDI), or through an installed midi port. (WARNING I have only tested on my \r\n\r\ncomputer. If it isn't working, the baud rate may need to be changed to work with \r\n\r\na midi port.)\r\n\r\nCan play in a range of 2 2/3 octaves (32 notes) through increasingly intense fret \r\n\r\nprogressions. In general, the more fret buttons held down, the higher the note. \r\n\r\nThere's no option toggling or anything fancy, so you play it just like you would \r\n\r\nin the video game.\r\n\r\nThe code is commented well enough for you to change things if you like. reading \r\n\r\nthe comments in fret_map.ino will give you an idea of how to use the frets.\r\n\r\nthat said:\r\npressing start+select will toggle between chords and single notes.\r\nin chord mode, strum down for a major chord and up for a minor chord.\r\n\r\nyou can hammer-on when you keep the strum bar pressed down.\r\n\r\nwhammy bar sends a pitchbend signal\r\n\r\nto increase/decrease the base octave you play at, press select to go up, and \r\n\r\nstart to go down.\r\n\r\nhttp://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/\r\nhttp://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
